## GitHub Pages

We use GitHub Pages to host the contents of this website without having to maintain our own server.  GitHub Inc. collects the following data in so-called log files that your browser transmits:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request comes and information about browser and operating system.

This information is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. Thus, the data collection is done in correspondence with our legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 Letter f GDPR.

We do not have direct access to the data collected by Github Inc. We only receive an anonymized, statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page accessed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.

The contact address of GitHub Inc. is:

> GitHub Inc.  
> 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St
